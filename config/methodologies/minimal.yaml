# Core philosophy
philosophy:
  - Let structure emerge organically from your thinking
  - Tags over folders
  - Start simple, add complexity only when needed
  - Future-proof with plain text and minimal dependencies
  - Fast capture, minimal friction
  - Bottom-up organization

# Minimal folder structure
folders:
  - path: Inbox/
    purpose: Quick capture area for new notes
    description: Unprocessed notes and fleeting thoughts

  - path: Archive/
    purpose: Notes no longer actively used
    description: Optional archive for old or inactive notes

# Note types (deliberately simple)
note_types:
  note:
    folder: root
    description: Standard note - most notes should be this type
    properties:
      - created: YYYY-MM-DD
      - tags: []
    template: note.md
    naming: descriptive-kebab-case.md

  daily:
    folder: root
    description: Optional daily note for temporal anchoring
    properties:
      - type: daily
      - date: YYYY-MM-DD
    template: daily.md
    naming: YYYY-MM-DD.md

  inbox:
    folder: Inbox/
    description: Quick capture without overthinking
    properties:
      - created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
      - processed: false
    template: inbox.md
    naming: YYYYMMDD-quick-description.md

# Organization principles
organization:
  primary: Tags and links (not folders)
  folders: Use only when absolutely necessary
  naming: Descriptive, human-readable filenames
  structure: Emerges from usage, not pre-planned

# Tagging strategy
tags:
  philosophy: Tags are primary organizational tool
  style: flat or minimal hierarchy
  conventions:
    - Use tags liberally
    - Create tags naturally as you write
    - Don't overthink tag structure
    - Tags emerge from use, not planning

  common_patterns:
    content_types:
      - idea
      - reference
      - howto
      - definition
      - example

    status:
      - draft
      - complete
      - evergreen
      - seedling

    domains:
      - Create naturally based on your interests
      - No predefined list needed
      - Examples: writing, coding, health, reading

# Linking conventions
linking:
  style: wikilink
  philosophy: Link freely and frequently
  bidirectional: Rely on backlinks for navigation
  context: Add context around links when helpful

  patterns:
    - Link terms on first use
    - Create notes for concepts as needed
    - Don't worry about "orphan" notes
    - Let link structure emerge

# Workflow (intentionally simple)
workflow:
  capture:
    - Quick notes go to Inbox/
    - Don't overthink location or structure
    - Tag minimally if at all

  process:
    - Review Inbox/ when convenient (not daily required)
    - Move valuable notes to root
    - Add tags and links as you go
    - Delete or archive unneeded items

  create:
    - Start writing immediately
    - Add structure if/when needed
    - Link to related notes
    - Tag for findability

  review:
    - No strict review schedule
    - Browse tags and backlinks naturally
    - Refactor structure when pain points emerge
    - Archive inactive notes occasionally

# Search and discovery
discovery:
  methods:
    - Search by content (full-text search)
    - Browse by tags
    - Follow backlinks
    - Graph view for visual exploration
    - Random note for serendipity

  no_reliance_on:
    - Complex folder structures
    - Rigid categorization
    - Pre-planned organization

# Templates (minimal)
templates:
  default_note:
    - Title as heading
    - Optional tags
    - Content
    - Optional links section

  daily_note:
    - Date as heading
    - Free-form content
    - Optional sections if helpful

# Best practices
best_practices:
  start_simple:
    - Begin with just notes in root folder
    - Add Inbox/ if you need capture area
    - Add Archive/ if root gets cluttered

  evolve_naturally:
    - Don't create structure upfront
    - Add organization when clear need emerges
    - Refactor when friction appears

  fast_capture:
    - Remove barriers to creating notes
    - Perfect is the enemy of done
    - Edit and improve later

  link_freely:
    - Link generously
    - Create target notes when needed
    - Trust search and backlinks

  trust_emergence:
    - Structure reveals itself over time
    - Your needs guide organization
    - Bottom-up beats top-down

# What to avoid
avoid:
  - Complex folder hierarchies
  - Over-planning structure
  - Excessive tagging schemes
  - Rigid templates
  - Perfectionism in capture
  - Analysis paralysis

# Optional additions (add only if needed)
optional_features:
  daily_notes:
    when: If you want temporal anchoring
    where: Root folder with YYYY-MM-DD.md naming

  projects:
    when: If managing active work
    how: Create project notes, link related content, use tags

  maps:
    when: Topic gets complex
    how: Create index/map note with links to related notes
