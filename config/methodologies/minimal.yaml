# Core philosophy
philosophy:
  - Let structure emerge organically from your thinking
  - Tags over folders
  - Start simple, add complexity only when needed
  - Future-proof with plain text and minimal dependencies
  - Fast capture, minimal friction
  - Bottom-up organization

# Organization principles
organization:
  primary: Tags and links (not folders)
  folders: Use only when absolutely necessary
  naming: Descriptive, human-readable filenames
  structure: Emerges from usage, not pre-planned

# Tagging strategy
tags:
  philosophy: Tags are primary organizational tool
  style: flat or minimal hierarchy
  conventions:
    - Use tags liberally
    - Create tags naturally as you write
    - Don't overthink tag structure
    - Tags emerge from use, not planning

  common_patterns:
    content_types:
      - idea
      - reference
      - howto
      - definition
      - example

    status:
      - draft
      - complete
      - evergreen
      - seedling

# Linking conventions
linking:
  style: wikilink
  philosophy: Link freely and frequently
  bidirectional: Rely on backlinks for navigation
  patterns:
    - Link terms on first use
    - Create notes for concepts as needed
    - Don't worry about orphan notes
    - Let link structure emerge

# Workflow (intentionally simple)
workflow:
  capture:
    - Quick notes go to Inbox
    - Don't overthink location or structure
    - Tag minimally if at all

  process:
    - Review Inbox when convenient
    - Move valuable notes to Notes folder
    - Add tags and links as you go
    - Delete or archive unneeded items

  create:
    - Start writing immediately
    - Add structure if/when needed
    - Link to related notes
    - Tag for findability

  review:
    - No strict review schedule
    - Browse tags and backlinks naturally
    - Refactor structure when pain points emerge

# Search and discovery
discovery:
  methods:
    - Search by content (full-text search)
    - Browse by tags
    - Follow backlinks
    - Graph view for visual exploration
    - Random note for serendipity

  no_reliance_on:
    - Complex folder structures
    - Rigid categorization
    - Pre-planned organization

# Best practices
best_practices:
  start_simple:
    - Begin with just notes in root folder
    - Add folders only if you need them
    - Keep it minimal

  evolve_naturally:
    - Don't create structure upfront
    - Add organization when clear need emerges
    - Refactor when friction appears

  fast_capture:
    - Remove barriers to creating notes
    - Perfect is the enemy of done
    - Edit and improve later

  link_freely:
    - Link generously
    - Create target notes when needed
    - Trust search and backlinks

  trust_emergence:
    - Structure reveals itself over time
    - Your needs guide organization
    - Bottom-up beats top-down

# What to avoid
avoid:
  - Complex folder hierarchies
  - Over-planning structure
  - Excessive tagging schemes
  - Rigid templates
  - Perfectionism in capture
  - Analysis paralysis

# Scaling strategy
scaling:
  small_vault:
    - Just notes in root
    - Tags for organization
    - Search for discovery

  medium_vault:
    - Add structure notes for complex topics
    - More consistent tagging
    - Consider Daily notes

  large_vault:
    - Hub notes for major themes
    - More metadata if helpful
    - Still avoid deep folder hierarchies

# Portability
portability:
  - Plain markdown files
  - Standard wikilinks
  - Minimal metadata
  - No proprietary formats
  - Easy to move between tools
