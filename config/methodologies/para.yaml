# EXTENDED DOCUMENTATION (Additional context, not used by init_vault.py)
# =============================================================================

# Organizational principles
principles:
  - Projects have clear outcomes and deadlines
  - Areas have standards to maintain but no end date
  - Resources are references without active work
  - Archives preserve completed or inactive items
  - Move items between categories as their status changes

# Movement rules
movement_rules:
  project_to_archive:
    trigger: status equals completed or on-hold for 30+ days
    action: Move to Archives/ with archived metadata

  area_to_archive:
    trigger: No longer an active responsibility
    action: Move to Archives/ with archived metadata

  resource_to_archive:
    trigger: No longer relevant or accessed
    action: Move to Archives/ with archived metadata

  archive_to_active:
    trigger: Becomes relevant again
    action: Move back to original category and update status

# Workflow
workflow:
  daily_review:
    - Check Projects/ for tasks due today
    - Update project status and progress
    - Move completed projects to Archives/

  weekly_review:
    - Review all active Projects
    - Check Areas for standard maintenance
    - Archive completed or stale items
    - Create new Projects from Areas if needed

  monthly_review:
    - Review all Areas for alignment
    - Clean up Resources
    - Archive inactive Resources
    - Review Archives for items to purge

# Linking conventions
linking:
  style: wikilink
  project_to_area: Projects should link to their parent Area
  area_to_project: Areas should link to active Projects
  resource_to_project: Resources can be referenced by Projects

# Tags strategy
tags:
  use_nested: true
  conventions:
    - "status/ (e.g., status/active, status/completed)"
    - "priority/ (e.g., priority/high, priority/low)"
    - "context/ (e.g., context/work, context/personal)"

# Search and retrieval
search:
  by_status: Use status property to find active vs completed
  by_deadline: Sort projects by deadline property
  by_area: Filter projects by their parent area
  by_archive_date: Find recently archived items

# Integration with productivity systems
integrations:
  task_management: Projects contain actionable tasks
  calendar: Project deadlines sync with calendar
  note_taking: Resources store research and reference material
  review_system: Weekly/monthly reviews maintain the system
