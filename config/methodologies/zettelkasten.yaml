# Core principles
principles:
  - Atomic notes - one idea per note
  - Unique identifiers - timestamp-based IDs
  - Flat structure - minimal folders
  - Dense linking - connect related ideas
  - Progressive elaboration - build knowledge over time
  - Folgezettel - continuation notes

# Folder structure (minimal by design)
folders:
  - path: Zettelkasten/
    purpose: Main slip-box for all notes
    description: Flat structure with timestamp-based filenames

  - path: Inbox/
    purpose: Temporary storage for new ideas and captures
    description: Processing area before creating permanent notes

  - path: References/
    purpose: Literature notes and bibliographic information
    description: Source material and citations

  - path: Indexes/
    purpose: Entry points into the Zettelkasten
    description: Structure notes that provide navigation

# Note types
note_types:
  zettel:
    folder: Zettelkasten/
    description: Atomic permanent note with a single idea
    properties:
      - type: zettel
      - id: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
      - tags: []
      - related: []
      - folgezettel: []
    template: zettel.md
    naming: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.md

  index:
    folder: Indexes/
    description: Structure note providing entry point and overview
    properties:
      - type: index
      - topic: ""
      - tags: []
      - main_zettels: []
    template: index.md
    naming: descriptive-name.md

  hub:
    folder: Indexes/
    description: Central hub connecting related structure notes
    properties:
      - type: hub
      - topic: ""
      - indexes: []
      - key_zettels: []
    template: hub.md
    naming: hub-topic-name.md

  literature:
    folder: References/
    description: Notes from external sources
    properties:
      - type: literature
      - source: ""
      - author: ""
      - title: ""
      - year: ""
      - url: ""
      - date_read: YYYY-MM-DD
      - tags: []
    template: literature.md
    naming: Author-YYYY-ShortTitle.md

  fleeting:
    folder: Inbox/
    description: Quick capture of thoughts and ideas
    properties:
      - type: fleeting
      - created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
      - processed: false
    template: fleeting.md
    naming: YYYYMMDD-description.md

# ID generation
id_format:
  type: timestamp
  format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
  example: "20231223143022"
  timezone: local
  uniqueness: Guaranteed by timestamp precision

# Folgezettel - Continuation notes
folgezettel:
  description: Notes that continue or branch from another note
  implementation: Link using 'folgezettel' property
  convention: Direct continuation of thought from parent note
  usage: When expanding on a specific aspect of a note

# Linking strategy
linking:
  style: wikilink
  required_links: Every zettel should link to at least one other note
  link_types:
    - direct_relation: Notes on same topic
    - contrast: Notes with opposing views
    - continuation: Folgezettel relationship
    - source: Link back to literature note
    - index: Link from structure note to zettels

  link_context: Always add context around links explaining the relationship

# Workflow
workflow:
  capture:
    - Capture ideas in Inbox/ as fleeting notes
    - Don't worry about structure or perfection

  process:
    - Review fleeting notes daily
    - Create permanent zettels from valuable ideas
    - Delete or archive processed fleeting notes

  create_zettel:
    - Write in your own words
    - One idea per note
    - Add unique timestamp ID
    - Link to related zettels
    - Add to relevant index notes

  develop_knowledge:
    - Follow links to discover connections
    - Create new zettels when gaps appear
    - Build index notes to navigate topics
    - Create hub notes for major themes

  literature_notes:
    - Create literature note for source
    - Extract key ideas as separate zettels
    - Link zettels back to literature note
    - Keep literature notes in References/

# Tags strategy
tags:
  use_sparingly: true
  purpose: Entry points and broad categorization
  conventions:
    - Keep tags minimal (3-5 per note max)
    - Use specific, meaningful tags
    - Tags complement links, don't replace them
  examples:
    - concept
    - method
    - example
    - definition
    - question

# Search and navigation
navigation:
  entry_points:
    - Index notes in Indexes/
    - Hub notes for major topics
    - Tag searches for broad exploration
    - Random note for serendipity

  following_threads:
    - Start with index or hub
    - Follow links based on interest
    - Create new zettels when gaps found
    - Update indexes with new connections

# Best practices
best_practices:
  atomicity:
    - One clear idea per zettel
    - Should be understandable standalone
    - Can be combined with other zettels

  own_words:
    - Rephrase source material
    - Ensure you understand the concept
    - Facilitates future understanding

  linking:
    - Link generously but meaningfully
    - Explain why notes are connected
    - Create surprise connections

  progressive:
    - Start simple, elaborate over time
    - Build on existing notes
    - Let structure emerge organically

  consistency:
    - Use same ID format always
    - Follow template structure
    - Regular processing of inbox

# Anti-patterns to avoid
avoid:
  - Overly complex folder structures
  - Copy-pasting without understanding
  - Isolated notes without links
  - Waiting for perfect organization
  - Hoarding notes without processing

# Integration
integrations:
  daily_notes: Optional - can link to zettelkasten from daily notes
  projects: Reference relevant zettels in project notes
  reading: Create literature notes, extract to zettels
  writing: Use zettelkasten as research and idea source
