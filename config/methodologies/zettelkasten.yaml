# =============================================================================

# Core principles
principles:
  atomicity:
    description: One idea per note
    rule: Each permanent note contains exactly one concept or thought

  connectivity:
    description: Notes must be linked
    rule: Every note should connect to at least one other note

  own_words:
    description: Write in your own words
    rule: Never copy-paste - always reformulate in your own words

  emergence:
    description: Let structure emerge
    rule: Don't pre-plan categories, let them emerge from connections

  flat_structure:
    description: Minimal folders
    rule: Use links instead of folder hierarchies

# ID format (optional for naming)
id_format:
  type: timestamp
  format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
  example: "20231223143022"
  description: Unique timestamp-based IDs for permanent notes

# Folgezettel - Continuation notes
folgezettel:
  description: Notes that continue or branch from another note
  convention: Direct continuation of thought from parent note
  implementation: Link using 'related' property with context

# Workflow
workflow:
  capture:
    - Capture ideas in Inbox as fleeting notes
    - Don't worry about structure or perfection
    - Quick capture is better than no capture

  process:
    - Review fleeting notes daily
    - Create permanent notes from valuable ideas
    - Delete or archive processed fleeting notes
    - Process within 24-48 hours

  create_permanent:
    - Write in your own words
    - One idea per note
    - Link to related permanent notes
    - Add to relevant index if needed

  literature:
    - Create literature note for each source
    - Extract key ideas as separate permanent notes
    - Link permanent notes back to literature note
    - Include source reference

# Linking conventions
linking:
  style: wikilink
  patterns:
    direct: Link directly to related concepts
    sequence: Use Folgezettel for argument chains
    hub: Create index notes for topic clusters

  link_types:
    - direct_relation: Notes on same topic
    - contrast: Notes with opposing views
    - continuation: Folgezettel relationship
    - source: Link back to literature note

# Tags strategy
tags:
  use_sparingly: true
  purpose: Only for broad categories, not for connections
  conventions:
    - Use sparingly - links are primary organization
    - Broad topics only (e.g., #philosophy, #programming)
    - Never use tags as replacement for links

# Search and navigation
navigation:
  methods:
    - Follow links between notes
    - Use index notes for topic entry points
    - Full-text search for specific content
    - Graph view for visual exploration

  entry_points:
    - Index notes for major topics
    - Recent permanent notes
    - Tag searches for exploration

# Best practices
best_practices:
  atomicity:
    - One clear idea per note
    - Should be understandable standalone
    - Can be combined with other notes

  own_words:
    - Rephrase source material
    - Ensure you understand the concept
    - Facilitates future understanding

  linking:
    - Link generously but meaningfully
    - Explain why notes are connected
    - Create surprise connections

  progressive:
    - Start simple, elaborate over time
    - Build on existing notes
    - Let structure emerge organically

# Anti-patterns to avoid
avoid:
  - Overly complex folder structures
  - Copy-pasting without understanding
  - Isolated notes without links
  - Waiting for perfect organization
  - Hoarding notes without processing
